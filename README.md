Kevin's personal website running on Hugo and Cloudflare.

**Note**: The source for this site was not created to be a template or theme,
but for my own use. Feel free to take whatever inspiration from it that you want,
but this code was not written with the intention of being cloned and deployed.
As such, I do not provide support or guidance for doing that. I recommend visiting
the [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) to learn how can you
set up your own site.
