My name is Kevin Su√±er. I'm a Spainard living in Barcelona. Code is what I use
to express myself.

Software Engineering is my speciality. Interested? You can learn more about my
work [here](/work)

In my spare time I enjoy building tools for the programming languages that I use,
building compilers, designing toy programming languages and creating web development
frameworks that no one will ever use. Tinkering with design is fun too, I learned
[Swiss Style (design)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Style_(design)) to make
this website. You can learn more about my projects [here](/projects)

I'm a motorsports enthusiast and I like to spend time driving karts, watching
[F1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One) and the
[WEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_World_Endurance_Championship) and as
soon as I get my driving license trying out the nearest race tracks.

Photography is something that brings me joy. I use it to capture things that have
caught my attention. I like it's passive nature as I don't actively look for things
that I can photograph. You can watch some of my photos [here](/photography)
