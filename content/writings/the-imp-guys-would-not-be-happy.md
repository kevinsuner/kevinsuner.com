During one of my trips to Wikipedia, which started with me reading about
Computer Graphics, Ivan Sutherland and the Sketchpad, I landed on an
article called "Intergalactic Computer Network" that sent me into a joyful
rabbit hole about the Internet and its creators. I was hooked and eager to
learn more about what to me is one of the most exciting times of the twentieth
century. A couple of round-trips later I found what appeared to be—according to
some kind individuals that left their opinions on the Internet—a book that told
the story in full detail, titled "Where Wizards Stay Up Late" by Katie Hefner
and Matthew Lyon.

That is the place from where the "IMP Guys" that you see in the header of this
article comes from, a group of visionaries and pioneers that assembled together
to work on J. C. R. Licklider vision of what computers could be, and set out
to make possible for computers with different architectures and from different
brands to talk to each other; and in doing so created what we have come to know
as the Internet, the backbone of our modern society, built with an almost
maniacal focus on reliability—as they couldn't allow themselves to flounder,
otherwise the already suspicious telecommunication companies would have buried
it under the ground—and decentralized by nature.

Not much has changed from its original design and implementation. We have added
things on top of it, that's for sure, but the foundation is still there and
holding strong. What is becoming more and more problematic is our over-reliance
on hosting providers, which at times throw half of the Internet into the void
for hours on end—yes, I'm talking about AWS and the "us-east-1" incident—.
This completely overrides two of its most important features and leaves the
future of our Internet in a tough spot. It is time to go back to first
principles and venture into the realms of self-hosting to honor and carry on the
legacy that the "IMP Guys" bestowed on us.

*PS, I will be self-hosting this site no later than next year.*
