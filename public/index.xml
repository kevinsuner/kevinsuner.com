      <title>If everything is a priority, nothing is</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always start my workday by looking at the tasks that have been assigned to me,&#xA;looking at their priority, and making a list with the ones that I want to complete.&#xA;This routine that I follow, clears my mind and allows me to go from task to task&#xA;without losing focus-and has worked in all the companies that I worked for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not all companies are the same, which is a thing I knew, and experienced, but in&#xA;terms of work organization, each had a similar approach, and deviating from the&#xA;assigned task, was the exception. The occasional hotfix¹ would popup from time to&#xA;time, as well as changes on the priority of some tasks, it was expected, and an&#xA;acceptable thing in all the teams I worked in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A job without a purpose kills a man&#39;s soul</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a known fact that many people derive meaning to their lives through work,&#xA;doing something that is useful to others, or has a purpose higher than oneself,&#xA;provides us with sentiments like pride and usefulness; take a brief look through&#xA;human history and see how far people were willing to go to achieve this feelings,&#xA;it speaks to us, and tells us that contrary to the popular belief that work is&#xA;just &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;, it has been one of the strongest driving forces that has led humanity&#xA;to where it is today, and that denying the need for a purposeful job is dangerous,&#xA;as it can lead many to live unfulfilling lives, or worse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The side effects of not having a clear separation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work from home and live in a not so tiny apartment, it has sufficient space to&#xA;allow me to have a dedicated office space, in which I spend roughly 8 to 10 hours&#xA;working for company X, and another 2 to 3 hours working on my own projects, totaling&#xA;10 to 13 hours per day. This configuration seemed reasonable to me, I thought that&#xA;after finishing my obligations, I could go for a walk, or do some other activity&#xA;and comeback to work on my own ideas, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be affected by the fact that&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve already been in that room for many hours, I was naive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An effective way to refine your coding skills</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways that we can use to improve our coding skills, most likely&#xA;you have already tried a few and found them useful but only to some extent, or maybe&#xA;you found out that some require you to invest an amount of time that you don&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;actually have. To give you more context I&amp;rsquo;ll be naming some of the most common paths&#xA;like learning different types of algorithms and their use cases, making a project&#xA;from scratch or following coding tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My take on open source</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/writings/my-take-on-open-source/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/writings/my-take-on-open-source/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;ldquo;open source&amp;rdquo; was coined in 1998, the year that the company behind Netscape&#xA;decided to give away their source code, an event that started to pave the way for&#xA;a new form of sharing knowledge and building together in the open. Never in the&#xA;history of human-kind have we had the possibility to change how things work&#xA;collectively, as knowledge has been usually stored in books, or in the brains of&#xA;a few humans that may or may not have shared it with others. Today you can be&#xA;a participant on how the future of money evolves by contributing to the development&#xA;of Bitcoin with your own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An artisan sometimes makes his tools</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As developers we often hear the term &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t reinvent the wheel&amp;rdquo; and for the most&#xA;part we are ok with it, but what if I want to reinvent the wheel? The majority of&#xA;programming languages that we use today, already handle many things so we don&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;need to, and if the language itself does not come with something that you need,&#xA;someone who came across the same problem, probably found a solution and shared it&#xA;somewhere on the internet, but what if after using the found solution I want to&#xA;understand more deeply how it works and tailor it to my needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Kevin Suñer. I&amp;rsquo;m a Spainard living in Barcelona. Code is what I use&#xA;to express myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Software Engineering is my speciality. Interested? You can learn more about my&#xA;work &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/work&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my spare time I enjoy building tools for the programming languages that I use,&#xA;building compilers, designing toy programming languages and creating web development&#xA;frameworks that no one will ever use. Tinkering with design is fun too, I learned&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Style_(design)&#34;&gt;Swiss Style (design)&lt;/a&gt; to make&#xA;this website. You can learn more about my projects &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/projects&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/work/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My career unprofessionally started in the 2010s by helping family members and&#xA;friends with design and websites. This eventually led me to land my first job&#xA;as a developer at WEDEVELAPPS in 2018. I joined the company shortly after it&#xA;had been founded, and got to work on the analysis, design and development&#xA;phases of an online streaming platform for academic football, and an e-commerce&#xA;website for an eyewear company, which gave me exposure on how software was being&#xA;made in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
