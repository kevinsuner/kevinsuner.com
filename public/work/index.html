    <h2 class="font-inter-semibold mb-5">Professional highlights</h2>
    <div style="column-count: 3;">
        <p>My career unprofessionally started in the 2010s by helping family members and
friends with design and websites. This eventually led me to land my first job
as a developer at WEDEVELAPPS in 2018. I joined the company shortly after it
had been founded, and got to work on the analysis, design and development
phases of an online streaming platform for academic football, and an e-commerce
website for an eyewear company, which gave me exposure on how software was being
made in the real world.</p>
<p>Shortly after finishing the internship, I started working for myself creating
landing pages for small businesses in my area, and doing gigs that I found on
freelancing websites. All of this allowed me to have a source of income to fund
an online gaming community I created with a few friends.</p>
<p>In 2022 I joined a startup called MobyFox as one of the early employees when
the whole team could fit in a tiny room. I landed in one of the most exciting
moments, as we were beginning to rebuild our internal content management system,
due to an increased demand for digital content in both smartphones and
smartwatches, which provided us with the opportunity to turn our in-house solution
into a new line of business by offering it as a software-as-a-service to companies
that had our same necessities. This allowed me to work hand in hand with my then
technical leader, Nahuel Fontan, to shape the project&rsquo;s architecture, influence
its direction and be in-charge of building and delivering complex systems such
as our own identity provider.</p>
<p>After an incredible time at MobyFox, I moved to Top Doctors where I&rsquo;m working on
improving their eHealth platform, adding new integrations and expanding its
customer base to help individuals looking for medical attention, discover and
access top of the line doctors that suit their needs.</p>
