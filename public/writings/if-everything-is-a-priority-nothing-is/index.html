<p>Not all companies are the same, which is a thing I knew, and experienced, but in

in my workday, to have a list of prioritized tasks to complete, and ending up having
done one or none. Such problem happens by various reasons, the ones that I have
identified are-having each stakeholder of the project pushing their own agendas and

an amount of tech debt so high, and a level of confidence in the code so low, that
almost every deployment comes with its many issues that need to be quickly fixed.</p>
<p>The second is solvable, the first is pure drama, project managers do many things to
keep the train from derailing, but when tasks are imposed by the ones that provide
money to keep things rolling, and each has its own vision of what the project should be,
everything becomes a priority, and nothing ends up being one.</p>
