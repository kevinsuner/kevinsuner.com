            <div><p>The term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; was coined in 1998, the year that the company behind Netscape
decided to give away their source code, an event that started to pave the way for
a new form of sharing knowledge and building together in the open. Never in the
history of human-kind have we had the possibility to change how things work
collectively, as knowledge has been usually stored in books, or in the brains of
a few humans that may or may not have shared it with others. Today you can be
a participant on how the future of money evolves by contributing to the development
of Bitcoin with your own ideas.</p>
<p>And this is just the beginning, almost all inventions that have been created across
time, had an entity who owned them in order to protect it, but now we have a role
in this play, and many companies noticed that by liberating their ideas and making
them open to contributors, they were able to build stronger products and form a
community around them, while others saw this as an opportunity to cut costs as
they could simply grab someone else&rsquo;s solution for free. But there&rsquo;s a catch,
software needs to be updated, maintained and from time to time something will
fail, implying that a person needs to be behind to ensure it keeps working, and
it could be a possibility that the one who built it, or the contributor that took
over the project, may have a better idea on where they should be spending their time.</p>
