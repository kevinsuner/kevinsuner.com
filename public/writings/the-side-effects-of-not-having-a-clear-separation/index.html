allow me to have a dedicated office space, in which I spend roughly 8 to 10 hours
working for company X, and another 2 to 3 hours working on my own projects, totaling
10 to 13 hours per day. This configuration seemed reasonable to me, I thought that

and comeback to work on my own ideas, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be affected by the fact that

<p>To get out of this pit I bought a laptop, since I didn&rsquo;t have one, and has been my

the couch, my kitchen table or a coffee shop that is close by, providing an almost
immediate improvement to my health, which I&rsquo;m grateful for.</p>
<p>I undervalued the importance of having a clear separation, and paid the price, lesson learnt.
